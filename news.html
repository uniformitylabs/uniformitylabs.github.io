                  <div class="mb-30">
                    <p>Uniformity Labs (Uniformity), a leading additive manufacturing (AM) company that is revolutionizing industrial 3D printing processes, has appointed Geoffrey Doyle as Vice President of Business Development and Walter Tersigni as Vice President of Sales – both reporting directly to CEO Adam Hopkins. The appointments follow the completion of a $38.35 million Series B financing round announced earlier this month.</p><br/>

                    <p>Before joining Uniformity full-time, Geoffrey Doyle was a founding advisor to the board of directors. He is an entrepreneur with an extensive background in venture capital and innovation. For the last decade, he has been working with and advising companies developing additive manufacturing and 3D scanning technologies, many of which were acquired by large US companies. Before joining Uniformity, he was Director of Business Development at Jabil Inc., most recently focused on strategy and M&A for the healthcare division. He was also a Jabil Additive leadership team member with responsibilities for strategy, customer engagements, and defining new business models for metal additive manufacturing.</p><br/>

                    <p>Walter Tersigni is a results-driven sales executive with more than 20 years of sales management experience in the highly competitive technology industry. He joins Uniformity Labs after supporting leadership roles for three Fortune 500 Electronics Manufacturers - Sanmina, Flex, and, most recently, Jabil Inc., where he served as Vice President of Business Development.  Walter was responsible for global sales and business development for Jabil’s Green Point division.</p><br/>

                    <p>“We’re delighted to have the services of two highly-experienced business development executives as we begin to scale the business globally,” said founder and CEO Adam Hopkins. “Their deep industry knowledge and track record of success are critical to helping us communicate the fundamental value that our technology delivers.”</p><br/>

                    <p>“What attracted me to Uniformity from the beginning was the deep scientific approach Adam and the team created to address a key problem of metal AM adoption – high cost per part due to long processing time in expensive equipment,” Doyle said. “By applying simple physics to solve a complex AM process challenge, Uniformity greatly improves part strength and accuracy, reducing cost and increasing commercial viability – this is great for AM adoption. The advancements their technology is making in thermal Powder Bed Fusion, and powder-based processes like Binder Jetting will transform the industry.”</p><br/>

                    <p>“I am very excited to be part of the team driving the next stage of growth at Uniformity,” Tersigni said. Adam and the team have created game-changing technology and processes that will transform the AM industry.”</p><br/>

                    <p>Uniformity Labs develops breakthrough material and software solutions to accelerate and expand global commercial/industrial 3D printing (AM) markets. Its patented technology enables significant cost savings, speed, and quality improvements across all mainstream AM printers. Uniformity’s feedstock materials and print processes dramatically impact the AM value chain by increasing the reliability and efficiency of printing.</p><br/>

                  <div class="mb-30">
                    <p>Uniformity Labs (UL), a leading additive manufacturing (AM) company that is revolutionizing industrial 3D printing processes, has completed a $38.35 million Series B financing round. In this latest round, existing investors were joined by new investment from financial and strategic investors.</p><br/>

                    <p>“This marks a significant milestone in our next phase of growth as we scale our game-changing metal feedstock and print applications businesses to greatly improve the 3D printing value proposition for major manufacturers,” said Adam Hopkins, founder and CEO of Uniformity Labs. “What’s important about this round is the level of commitment from new financial and strategic industry investors, which stands as an important endorsement of our technology and business model.”</p><br/>

                    <p>The proceeds of this round of funding will predominantly drive the expansion of its production capability and the development of additional specialized materials. It will also fuel the growth of the senior team, particularly in the sales and marketing function – a process that will ramp up substantially over the course of 2021.</p><br/>

                    <p>“As its founding investor, IP Group is excited to see Uniformity Labs poised to disrupt the AM market.  Adam Hopkins and his team have done a tremendous job developing the core technology created in Professor Sal Torquato’s labs at Princeton University to unlock the potential of powder-based manufacturing.  UL is an excellent example of our focus on supporting the commercial development of innovative hard science from premier research institutions like Princeton,” said Michael Burychka, CEO of IP Group, Inc.</p><br/>

                    <p>The Series B round included an investment to finance plant construction from a fund managed by Orion Resource Partners, a global alternative investment management firm with approximately $6.3 billion under management. Orion is one of the world’s leading investors in the mining, metals processing, and metal commodity trading industries.</p><br/>

                    <p>“Orion is pleased to make its first investment into the additive manufacturing and metals atomization industries through Uniformity Labs. We look forward to supporting their growth within this rapidly evolving industry,” said Oskar Lewnowski, the Chief Investment Officer of Orion Resource Partners.</p><br/>

                    <p>Uniformity Labs develops breakthrough material and software solutions to accelerate and expand global commercial/industrial 3D printing (AM) markets. Its patented technology enables significant cost savings, speed, and quality improvements across all mainstream AM printers. Uniformity’s feedstock materials and print processes dramatically impact the AM value chain by increasing the reliability and efficiency of printing.</p><br/>

                    <p>Armory Securities acted as exclusive financial advisor and placement agent for UL for the Series B round. Mercator Partners, an asset manager located in Princeton, NJ, helped arrange and close the financing.</p><br/>
